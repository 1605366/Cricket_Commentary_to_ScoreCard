Or runs saved? Lockie Ferguson at deep backward square popped the ball up trying to catch it and then flicked the ball back into the playing area while his body toppled over the cushion. But he did well to stop it. The fence was on his mind and hence he dropped it thinking he will trip over. That was flighted and Miller again had picked up the slog sweep option to disperse the ball away\\n10.5\\nKuldeep Yadav to Miller, 6, and the sweep gets him out of jail. Emphatically. Knelt down and smacked it. The bat made a massive noise as it met the ball. The ball whistled over deep mid\\n10.4\\nKuldeep Yadav to Miller, no run, lucky! Slower delivery at 76kph and Miller was through with his cut shot too early.

So, he bent a little and whipped it away past the dive of the deep square leg fielder for a four.

Miller jabs at it and misses\\nSunil Narine, right-arm off break, comes into the attack\\nTime-out. A no-ball for three men inside the circle. An overthrow picked up late. Events and KXIP have tied the knot this year. But this ceremony today hasn\\'t been a smooth one. Three down for 70 at almost the half-way mark while chasing 200 plus isn\\'t an ideal case. But the adage -- if it\\'s in the arc, it\\'s out of the park still lives on with Miller still being there. Can him and Agarwal turn it around? Here is Narine into the attack after the break.\\nSmit Chhadva says: \"KXIP teaching us all the rules this season.

Did so of late against Lanka in the T20Is and now also repeating the same. Knelt down and swept it in front of square for a four\\n8.4\\nKuldeep Yadav to Miller, no run, another googly and has been misread. Off the inner half of the bat to short mid\\n8.3\\nKuldeep Yadav to Agarwal, 1 run, shortish delivery and has been chopped out to deep cover for a single\\n8.3\\nKuldeep Yadav to Agarwal, wide, too wide. Spills the googly too wide outside off and was wided as Agarwal left it alone\\n8.2\\nKuldeep Yadav to Miller, 1 run, tossed up delivery and has been driven down to long-off for a single.

Slower delivery gets the scalp here. That was down leg, Sarfaraz Khan ended up closing the face of the bat a bit too early and the leading edge was taken by the keeper, who moved to his left by quite a few paces to take it. Dre Russ continues his impact on this game. And have the deliveries started to hold on more now? Might well be the case. Sarfaraz Khan c Karthik b A Russell 13(13) [4s-2]\\nA Russell to Sarfaraz Khan, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!\\n7.2\\nA Russell to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, what lovely timing! Shortish delivery outside off and has been chopped behind point for a four.

Third one of the over. Sarfaraz Khan throws his bat at it and misses. Close to the edge it was\\n6.3\\nKuldeep Yadav to Agarwal, 1 run, little glue certainly on the wicket as the ball hangs on a little longer for the batter to wait to cut it away\\n6.2\\nKuldeep Yadav to Sarfaraz Khan, 1 run, looks to sweep and gets a top-edge.

The crowd has also found its voice. There is something that has ooccured which we aren\\'t aware of. Overthrow is it? The on-field umpires have got together. Karthik looks animated. Uthappa and few others have gathered around the umpires. Ashwin is along the boundary line trying to figure out what happened. The umpire has signalled it a four. But Sarfaraz Khan is still on strike. We will figure it out as the game progresses. And we have figured out what happened.

Usual Sarfaraz Khan stuff as he sits down on both knees and upper-steers it. Risky but effective\\n4.3\\nA Russell to Sarfaraz Khan, no run, sharp in-ducker at 137kph and Sarfaraz Khan misses the tuck. There was a huge appeal from Russell but that was high and going down\\nSarfaraz Khan, right handed bat, comes to the crease\\n4.2\\nA Russell to Gayle, out Caught by Prasidh! What can\\'t you do DreRuss? Have you got a deal cut out with the God of fortune? A short one at the body, not particularly quick @130.8km/h, Gayle gets his weight on the backfoot to pull it away, but with that bat-face turning upwards, gets it off the splice, skywards, as Prasidh runs in to pick it up at mid-on.

A fantastic first four balls, spoiled by the last two balls...\\n3.5\\nFerguson to Gayle, FOUR, short of length delivery on the stump, 115.9km/h, Gayle clears that leg and clubs it off the toe-end just over mid-on to the long-on fence for four\\n3.4\\nFerguson to Gayle, no run, yorker length delivery, inch-perfect, 148.2km/h, digs it out off the toe-end\\n3.3\\nFerguson to Gayle, no run, slower delivery on a good length heading for middle, Gayle delays his defence from the crease back down the wicket\\n3.3\\nFerguson to Gayle, wide, 148.1km/h, wide down leg, swings away after the ball crosses the batsman\\'s missed flick and swerves to the left of the \\'keeper who has done well to collect it\\n3.2\\nFerguson to Gayle, no run, a short one at the body, Gayle is early into the pull - not very slow @142.7km/h, and he misses it completely.

An abomination fo a shot for an Indian Test opener. Rahul backs away into the on-side, picks up a length ball from middle-stump, 145.7km/h, and tries to run his hands through the ball in chipping it over mid-off, miscues and and ends up lobbing it straight to the man at mid-off, succumbing in a rather soft manner.
